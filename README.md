# TrollRecorder

**WIP (Work-In-Progress)**: A simple audio recorder for TrollStore.

Partial codes are not open-sourced because they're contributed by my friends.

## Milestones

- [x] Playing &amp; recording via command-line interface
- [x] Pause &amp; resume via signals (`SIGUSR1` &amp; `SIGUSR2`)
- [x] Phone call recording via command-line interface
- [ ] Mix audio from both sides of a phone call
- [ ] Launch in background via App or “Shortcuts”
- [ ] Status indicator with a global HUD
- [ ] Records saved to “Voice Memos”
- [ ] Use `SFSpeechRecognizer` to transcribe records
